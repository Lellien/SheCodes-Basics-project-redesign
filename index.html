                  I cannot start my day without a hot cup of tea at breakfast. I
                  like most black leaf teas, but I am particularly partial to a
                  milky Earl Grey.<br />
                  <br />
                  From late-afternoon I try to limit my caffeine intake and will
                  usually opt for a herbal infusion instead, such as ginger,
                  mint or camomile tea. <br />
                  <br />
                  For variety, I like a 'chai latte', which is a relatively
                  modern take on Indian spiced tea, using steamed milk. This
                  concoction is available at many cafes and allows me to pretend
                  I'm joining the coffee-drinking population without being fully
                  led astray.

                  I live in England, UK, where people are mad for tea!
                  Nationally, more than 100 million cups of tea are consumed per
                  day, with individuals averaging 2-5.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Tea drinking is intrinsic to British society as the basis of
                  many cultural norms- both formal customs, and themes in daily
                  life and language. For instance, ‘Tea’ is designated as the
                  evening meal in many parts of the country.

                  A 'cuppa' is a great comfort, cherished in everyday modern UK.
                  In the cold or on a bad day, 'putting the kettle on' is a
                  tried and tested social device that serves to facilitate
                  resolution by initiating self care and conversation over a
                  shared teapot.

                  ‘Afternoon tea’ is a light meal of tea with snacks served on a
                  tiered stand, eaten around 4pm. Invented by the Duchess of
                  Bedford circa 1840, it was the premise for the ‘tea party’-
                  the formal social gatherings associated with this meal and
                  possibly the most well known tea inspired ritual. These were
                  very prestigious high society events, and showcased fancy
                  cutlery and table settings as well as elegant ‘tea’ gowns.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Nowadays, afternoon tea is not restricted to the aristocracy,
                  but does tend to be considered a rare treat reserved for
                  special occasions. Vouchers are commonly gifted for an
                  ‘afternoon tea experience’ at local tea rooms and hotels.

                  Tea is linked to Britishness in many literary works. A famous
                  example is the Mad Hatter’s tea party in Lewis Carol’s
                  ‘Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland’.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Disney films use tea as an effective stereotype for character
                  and setting.‘101 Dalmatians’, set in London, has numerous
                  visual references to tea. By direct contrast, ‘Lady and the
                  Tramp’ set in the US, only shows coffee drinking.
                  <br />
                  The very English ‘Mary Popins’ has another famous tea party -
                  on the ceiling! Characters are also seen to sip or mention tea
                  throughout the film.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In TV, two iconic Sci-fi characters are known tea lovers - The
                  Doctor (from Doctor Who) and Star Trek’s Captain Picard.
