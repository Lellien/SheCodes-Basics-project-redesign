              I cannot start my day without a hot cup of tea at breakfast. I
              like most black leaf teas, but I am particularly partial to a
              milky Earl Grey.<br />
              <br />
              From late-afternoon I try to limit my caffeine intake and will
              usually opt for a herbal infusion instead, such as ginger, mint or
              camomile tea. <br />
              <br />
              For variety, I like a 'chai latte', which is a relatively modern
              take on Indian spiced tea, using steamed milk. This concoction is
              available at many cafes and allows me to pretend I'm joining the
              coffee-drinking population without being fully led astray.

              I live in England, UK, where people are mad for tea! Nationally,
              more than 100 million cups of tea are consumed per day, with
              individuals averaging 2-5.
              <br />
              <br />
              Tea drinking is intrinsic to British society as the basis of many
              cultural norms- both formal customs, and themes in daily life and
              language. For instance, ‘Tea’ is designated as the evening meal in
              many parts of the country.
              <br />
              <br />
              A 'cuppa' is a great comfort, cherished in everyday modern UK. In
              the cold or on a bad day, 'putting the kettle on' is a tried and
              tested social device that serves to facilitate resolution by
              initiating self care and conversation over a shared teapot.

              ‘Afternoon tea’ is a light meal of tea with snacks served on a
              tiered stand, eaten around 4pm. Invented by the Duchess of Bedford
              circa 1840, it was the premise for the ‘tea party’- the formal
              social gatherings associated with this meal and possibly the most
              well known tea inspired ritual. These were very prestigious high
              society events, and showcased fancy cutlery and table settings as
              well as elegant ‘tea’ gowns. <br />
              <br />
              Nowadays, afternoon tea is not restricted to the aristocracy, but
              does tend to be considered a rare treat reserved for special
              occasions. Vouchers are commonly gifted for an ‘afternoon tea
              experience’ at local tea rooms and hotels.

              Tea is linked to Britishness in many literary works. A famous
              example is the Mad Hatter’s tea party in Lewis Carol’s ‘Alice’s
              Adventures in Wonderland’.
              <br />
              <br />
              Disney films use tea as an effective stereotype for character and
              setting.‘101 Dalmatians’, set in London, has numerous visual
              references to tea. By direct contrast, ‘Lady and the Tramp’ set in
              the US, only shows coffee drinking.
              <br />
              The very English ‘Mary Popins’ has another famous tea party - on
              the ceiling! Characters are also seen to sip or mention tea
              throughout the film.
              <br />
              <br />
              In TV, two iconic Sci-fi characters are known tea lovers -Doctor
              Who and Star Trek’s Captain Picard.
